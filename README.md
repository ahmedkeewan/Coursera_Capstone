# The battle of Amman neighborhoods

Purpose of this project was to identify Amman areas that
are popular with a low number of restaurants, in order to
aid stakeholders in narrowing down the search for the
optimal location for a restaurant. By calculating venue
frequency distribution from Foursquare data.

Clustering of those locations was then performed in order to
create major zones of interest (containing greatest number of
potential locations) and addresses of those zones were used
for final exploration by stakeholders.

Final decision on optimal restaurant location will be made by
stakeholders based on specific characteristics of
neighborhoods and locations in every recommended zone,
taking into consideration additional factors like frequency of
each venue in each location and its density.
